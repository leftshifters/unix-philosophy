# unix-philosophy


#### 1. Rule of Modularity: Write simple parts connected by clean interfaces.

#### 2. Rule of Clarity: Clarity is better than cleverness.

#### 3. Rule of Composition: Design programs to be connected to other programs.

#### 4. Rule of Separation: Separate policy from mechanism; separate interfaces from engines.

#### 5. Rule of Simplicity: Design for simplicity; add complexity only where you must.

#### 6. Rule of Parsimony: Write a big program only when it is clear by demonstration that nothing else will do.

#### 7. Rule of Transparency: Design for visibilty to make inspection and debugging easier.

#### 8. Rule of Robustness: Robustness is the child of transparency and simplicity.

#### 9. Rule of Representation: Fold knowledge into data so program logic can be stupid and robust.

#### 10. Rule of Least Suprise: In interface desgin, always do the least surprising thing.

#### 11. Rule of Silence: When a program has nothing surprising to say, it should say nothing.

#### 12. Rule of Repair: When you must fail, fail nosiliy and as soon as possible.

#### 13. Rule of Economy: Programmer time is expensive; conserve it in preference to machine time.

#### 14. Rule of Generation: Avoid hand-hacking; write programs to write programs when you can.

#### 15. Rule of Optimization: Prototype before polishing. Get it working before you optimize it.

#### 16. Rule of Diversity: Distrust all claims for "one true way".

#### 17. Rule of Extensibility: Design for the future, because it will be here sooner than you think.
